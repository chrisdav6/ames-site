              Over the years, we have worked side-by-side with the paving
              industry and government agencies to develop systems that yield
              exceptional data accuracy and performance. Starting with the
              original Ames Profilograph, we have continually pushed the bounds
              with our TriODS sensor, then our LMI RoLine- and Gocator-based
              sensors, and now with our Transverse and Texture measurement
              sensors, all being run by our ever-improving Ames Profiler
              software.
